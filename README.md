BottleCMS
=========

A really simple CMS build with Bottle and MongoDB

Why another CMS? There are plenty of CMS systems out there so why did I make a new one?
I wanted to challenge myself to make an easy CMS in Bottle and MongoDB and probally use it myself.

Because of MongoDB the database becomes really flexible. Since I don't have many relations, MongoDB is a
good choice here.
